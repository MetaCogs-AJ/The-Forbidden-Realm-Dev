Development files and backup for my new game - The Forbidden Realm

This is 100% created by me, so there is no copyright as this is all source code. This game is a text-based game about outliving your
opponent. To use this, download all the most recent files into the same folder in an accessable area then run MAIN.py in Python. The Python
version used here is the Python 3.7.0 patch, so make sure you have that installed before playing:
